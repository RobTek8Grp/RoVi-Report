\chapter{Preliminary Results}
Evaluation of the system is based on a comparison between the hand-eye calibration module implemented in ROS and the proposed application specific calibration. Although several experiments were made, they mostly served to get acquainted with the system and the results are insufficient to draw any final conclusions. In the following the observations will be presented and discussed.

The experiments consisted of running the system approximately 20 times varying the object, density of views, parameters on the camera, parameters on the carmine sensor, lighting conditions, stitching parameters, classic hand-eye calibration, the proposed method for calibrations etc. In all cases the performance of the system was poor and thus quantitative comparison to the original model was omitted.
