\chapter{Results and Discussion}
To evaluate the performance of the system, a series of paired experiments were made before and after calibration. In the experiments three known (true 3D model is present) objects with different level of detail were used (Figure \ref{fig:objects}). In each experiment the robot goes through the 24 \marginnote{???} poses, capturing the object from 24 viewpoints. The system is then calibrated based on the results and the test is repeated. From each experiment two 3D models are built one before and one after calibration.

\subsection{Evaluating the calibration}
To evaluate the models built before calibration are visually compared to the models built after calibration to assess the improvement. More quantitative measures could be made, but if the difference is not visible to the naked eye, it is not worth doing the calibration. 

\subsection{Evaluating the reconstruction}
To evaluate the combined reconstruction process the 3D models from the experiments are compared to the known model in a quantitative way...
