\chapter{Modelling}
The task of reconstructing an unknown surface from a point cloud is not a trivial task. Especially not when this point cloud is obtained through a camera mounted as the tool on a robot arm. To be able to reconstruct the full surface several views of the object are required, which mean that several point clouds are required to be aligned with each other and stitched together. The modelling component of this system is divided into two sub-components, the first component described in this chapter is filtering and the second component described is the reconstruction component.
