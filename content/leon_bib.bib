@article{Hirschmuller2008,
abstract = {This paper describes the Semi-Global Matching (SGM) stereo method. It uses a pixelwise, Mutual Information based matching cost for compensating radiometric differences of input images. Pixelwise matching is supported by a smoothness constraint that is usually expressed as a global cost function. SGM performs a fast approximation by pathwise optimizations from all directions. The discussion also addresses occlusion detection, subpixel refinement and multi-baseline matching. Additionally, postprocessing steps for removing outliers, recovering from specific problems of structured environments and the interpolation of gaps are presented. Finally, strategies for processing almost arbitrarily large images and fusion of disparity images using orthographic projection are proposed.A comparison on standard stereo images shows that SGM is among the currently top-ranked algorithms and is best, if subpixel accuracy is considered. The complexity is linear to the number of pixels and disparity range, which results in a runtime of just 1-2s on typical test images. An in depth evaluation of the Mutual Information based matching cost demonstrates a tolerance against a wide range of radiometric transformations. Finally, examples of reconstructions from huge aerial frame and pushbroom images demonstrate that the presented ideas are working well on practical problems.},

@article{Manson2008,
abstract = {We present a streaming method for reconstructing surfaces from large data sets generated by a laser range scanner using wavelets. Wavelets provide a localized, multiresolution representation of functions and this makes them ideal candidates for streaming surface reconstruction algorithms. We show how wavelets can be used to reconstruct the indicator function of a shape from a cloud of points with associated normals. Our method proceeds in several steps. We first compute a low-resolution approximation of the indicator function using an octree followed by a second pass that incrementally adds fine resolution details. The indicator function is then smoothed using a modified octree convolution step and contoured to produce the final surface. Due to the local, multiresolution nature of wavelets, our approach results in an algorithm over 10 times faster than previous methods and can process extremely large data sets in the order of several hundred million points in only an hour.
